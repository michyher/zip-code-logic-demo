# ZIP Code Logic Demo

This is a simple React app that demonstrates conditional logic based on ZIP code input. It was inspired by real-world business needs from a past project involving regional availability and product catalog access.

## ✨ Features

- User enters a ZIP code
- Displays one of three conditional messages:
  - 📦 Catalog Only
  - 🛠️ Purchase + Installation Available
  - 🚫 Installation Not Available (Florida)
- Fully responsive UI
- Built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**
- Animated message transitions (fade-in effect)

## 🧠 Why I Built This

This demo is based on a logic system I implemented for a Costco Next partner’s site. The actual production code was private, but I recreated the logic here to demonstrate the flow and interactivity.

## 📂 Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zip-code-logic-demo.git
cd zip-code-logic-demo
npm install
npm start
